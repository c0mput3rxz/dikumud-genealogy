============================================================================

Welcome to CircleMUD 3.0!  I hope you enjoy your stay.

This file has a quick intro to what Circle is, followed by some tips on
how to get started quickly.


I.  Background and Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CircleMUD is a derivative of DikuMUD -- the Multi-User Dungeon developed
at DIKU (the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen).
Circle 1.0 ran at Johns Hopkins University with moderate popularity from
January to September of 1992.  Since June of 1993, it has been maintained
as a public code base that anyone can use to start a MUD, although there is
no specific MUD which is CircleMUD per se.

Hundreds of carefully spent hours have gone into the development of Circle,
but it is not a finished product -- it's only a beginning.  It has only
a small number of spells and skills, a small world with relatively few
areas, and only the 4 original Diku classes.  From a gamer's point of view,
it pales in comparison to other MUDs which have dozens of spells spread
over a dozen classes, a rich palette of skills, and thousands upon thousands
rooms, mobiles, and objects.

On the other hand, from a programmer's point of view, Circle is very highly
developed.  While the look and feel of the original DikuMUD has been
maintained, much of the underlying code and many of the structures have
been optimized, reworked, or completely redesigned to be efficient, compact,
and easily changable and extensible.  Dozens of features which have become
standard in the MUDding world over the past few years, although they were
not part of the original Diku release, were added to Circle.

The final product is a launching pad for your own MUD ideas.  My hope in
releasing Circle is that it will free potential MUD implementors from having
to worry about dealing with bug-ridden code or wasting time reinventing the
wheel by recoding standard MUD features, allowing them to devote more effort
towards creatively shaping Circle into their own unique vision of how a MUD
should look and feel.

So, it is with this message that I inflict my code on the world: don't
just put another generic MUD on the Net -- give us something new and
exciting, and have as much fun as possible in the process!


II.  Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before doing anything else, please look at license.doc in the circle/doc
directory.  It contains the original DikuMUD license distributed with the
original DikuMUD in 1990.  Since CircleMUD is based on the Diku code, the
DikuMUD license still applies -- this means you!

USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IN ANY CAPACITY IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD,
AND AGREED TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET DOWN BY THE DIKUMUD
LICENSE.

Also, out of courtesy if nothing else, please keep the 'credits' file
intact.  You can add your own credits on top of the existing file, but
I'd appreciate it if you would not simply remove it and all references
to the word "Circle" everywhere in the MUD.


III.  Enough talk!  Let's get started already.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're like me, you don't like to read a lot of documentation when you
have a neat new toy to play with.  In fact, if you've even read THIS far,
I'm impressed!  So, below, I've written some short tips on how the budding
but impatient MUD implementor can get started quickly.  However, you should
be aware that there is a wealth of additional information availible in the
/doc directory, and you'll be doing yourself a favor by reading over some
of it eventually.

The README file in the /doc directory describes each documentation file
in detail, but there are several main files which should be of interest.
For the administrative side of mudding, running.doc gives an overall
description of how Circle works, how to get it to compile for the first
time and get it running, and hints on maintenance and day-to-day
administration.  For the coding side, coding.doc dives into Circle's
code and describes how to add new commands, spells, skills, socials,
classes, and whatnot.  For the builders in your group, building.doc
describes how to create new worlds, including rooms, objects, mobiles,
and shops.

Now, as promised, my get-started-quickly tips:

*  All source code is in the /src directory.  Before compiling, take a
   look at the beginning of the Makefile and set options as required for
   your operating system.   Type 'make' to compile only the main Circle
   server; type 'make all' to make the server as well as Circle's dozen
   or so maintenance utilities.  running.doc in the doc/ directory has
   more information about compiling and compatibility.

*  The server should be run from Circle's root directory.  For debugging
   and testing, you can just type 'bin/circle &'.  To run the game for
   extended periods of time, use the autorun script instead.  autorun
   automatically reboots the game if it crashes, and handles moving old
   system logs into the /log directory.  The game will run on port 4000
   by default.

*  When the MUD boots, it will give status messages describing what it is
   doing to initialize itself.  Note that if you use 'autorun', these messages
   will automatically be written to a syslog file and will not appear on the
   screen.  If nothing goes wrong, the last message should be "Entering game
   loop.", follwed by "No connections.  Going to sleep."  This indicates that
   the MUD is operating normally, and is waiting for people to connect to it.

*  Use the 'telnet' program to connect to the MUD; i.e., type
   'telnet localhost 4000'.  Note that you must run the MUD in the background
   in order to be able to telnet to it from the same terminal.  Make sure
   you include '&' at the end of 'bin/circle' or 'autorun' to make sure the
   MUD is running in the background.

*  Make sure you don't run more than one copy of the MUD at once!  Before
   starting it, check whether or not other copies are already running by
   using the 'ps' or 'jobs' command.  Use the 'kill' command to kill old
   MUDs before starting new ones.

*  The first character who logs in to the game will be made a level 34 god.
   The first god can then use the 'advance' command to create other gods.
   Use the 'wizhelp' command to get a list of god commands; use the
   'commands' command to get a list of other commands.

*  There is a file in this directory called "FAQ" which contains the most
   frequently asked questions about CircleMUD and answers to them.  Read it!


If you have strange problems -- and you can't figure out the answer by
reading the docs -- fear not, there are many other resources you can
turn to.  The best is probably the CircleMUD Mailing List, which you can
subscribe to by writing mail to "majordomo@pvv.unit.no" with a message
body of "subscribe circle".  If you want to write mail to the list, address
it to "circle@pvv.unit.no".  Over 150 CircleMUD imps read that list
regularly, so chances are you'll get help very quickly.

If that doesn't work, you can always contact me directly by writing to
jelson@cs.jhu.edu.  Or, take a look at the CircleMUD Home Page which is
at http://www.cs.jhu.edu/other/jelson/circle.html, which may eventually
have some on-line documentation for Circle.

Good luck, and have fun!
