** NOTE **

This is a beta-test version of CircleMUD 3.0.

So....

1-  Please do not me ask 'newbie questions' about the MUD.  If you're a MUD
    newbie, stick with version 2.20.

2-  PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE send me as many bug reports as possible!  If you
    have sent a bug report in the past which hasn't been fixed in the current
    patchleve, please send it again.

3-  If the MUD does not compile 100% cleanly on your system the first time,
    please send me a detailed report of everything you had to do in order
    to get it to compile, as well as the name of your system.
