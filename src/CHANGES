Well, I should have started a changes file long, long ago.  Oh well,
I'll start one now.  Hopefully, I'll maintain it.  JE.


8/31/94 JE	Added a GET_REAL_LEVEL macro which returns the actual
		level taking switched characters into account.  Used
		in CAN_SEE so that switched immorts can't see invis
		gods.

8/31/94 JE	Added restriction to interpreter.c so that immort commands
		cannot be used by NPCs.  Removed all the IS_NPC checks from
		the individual god commands since they are now redundant.

8/31/94 JE	Made newsign.c into sign.c and deleted the old DIKU sign.c.
		newsign.c forks to handle its kids and is generally more
		concise and robust.

8/31/94 JE	Changed the type argument of affect_from_char and
		affected_by_spell to sh_int (from char) to match the fact
		that the 'type' member of the affected_type structure is
		now a sh_int instead of a char.  Spotted by Jean-Jack
		Riethoven.

8/31/94 JE	Fixed MIN statement using uninitialized 'water' var in
		spell_create_water.  Spotted by JJR.

8/31/94 JE	Ken Cavness noted that MOBs were getting past guildguards.
		Not surprising, since I changed the relationship between
		do_move/do_simple_move/perform_move so many times.  The
		discipline has now changed again; MOBs calling perform_move
		must call with 3rd arg of 1 instead of 0.  Changed the
		arg from 'following' to 'need_specials_check' so its purpose
		would be clearer.

8/31/94 JE	Added 'worn_on' short integer to obj_data structure to go
		with worn_by char_data pointer.  Indicates which eq pos
		eq is being worn on.  (Will be used to facilitate a cleaner
		version of objectmagic.)

8/31/94 JE	extract_obj now automatically unequips the obj first if it
		is being used as equipment (uses worn_by and the new worn_on).
		do_use no longer unequips.  objectmagic didn't have to be
		changed since extract_obj automatically does the work now. :)

8/31/94 JE	Fixed cityguard routine with a CAN_SEE check so that blinded
		guards no longer banzai people, and so that guards don't
		banzai invis people etc.  Spotted by Ken Cavness.

8/31/94 JE	Fixed do_reply to make sure the person you're replying to
		is still in the game before calling perform_tell.  Note, I
		think it still may be possible for your reply to go to
		someone else if the recipient logs out and someone else logs
		in.  In particular, this will break in a big way if I ever
		implement some scheme where it keeps a pool of char_data
		structures for reuse.

8/31/94 JE	CHA added to display when rerolling a character.

8/31/94 JE	Changed TOUNGE to TONGUE throughout.

8/31/94 JE	Made the '*' (ignore) case in zone reset tables (used for
		invalid vnums) set last_cmd = 0 for proper resetting.

8/31/94 JE	Enhanced (added?) NeXT compatibility with FOPEN_MAX, my_signal,
		and O_NDELAY.

8/31/94 JE	Changed boards back to listing lowest to highest since people
		seemed to hate it the other way.

8/31/94 JE	Added sanity checks to perform_move since king_welmar seems
		to cause crashes when he's moving on occassion, and I'd rather
		remove that area than try to debug it.

8/31/94 JE	Changed 'SEC' to 'RL_SEC' in structs.h to avoid conflicts
		with many OS's #defines of SEC

9/1/94	JE	Good God, is it September already?

9/1/94	JE	Changed list_skills to accumulate in a buffer instead of
		using send_to_char, and use page_string.  This system really
		sucks.  There should be a "page_to_char" command, or something.
		It shouldn't even require too much conceptual difference now
		that output buffers are limited!

9/1/94	JE	Added a 'sort_spells()' function and changed list_skills
		to use sorted spell list instead of arbitrarily ordered list.
		sort_spells() called once on boot from db.c.

9/1/94	JE	Finally finished making the background story paged.  Now that
		process_input and command_interpreter, etc., have been
		rewritten, all it took was changing it from SEND_TO_Q to
		page_string.  Whoo hoo!

9/1/94	JE	Jeff Fink suggested having perform_act do some run-time
		sanity checking in order to make it more robust.  Thus,
		I created the CHECK_NULL macro for it in comm.c.

9/1/94	JE	Made mobs hit you if you try to cast an offensive spell
		at them and fail.

9/1/94	JE	Completed line-by-line zone-parsing routines.  Instead of
		using scanf() to read from disk, Circle now uses fgets().
		This allows MUCH more robustness, more accurate and sensitive
		error-checking of zone files, both at boot-time and run-time.
		In addition, the error reporting now gives you a specific
		_line number_ in the zone file of the error. :)

9/2/94	JE	Made a 'qecho' command, combined with qsay in do_qcomm
		of act.comm.c.

9/2/94	JE	Updated the README file.

9/2/94	JE	Circle 3.00 beta patchlevel 3 released


-- Patchlevel 4


9/9/94	JE	Added IS_NPC check to do_score to prevent crashes.

9/9/94	JE	Added #undef MAX and MIN for NeXT compatibility.

9/19/94	JE	Started work again after 10 days of real life (school's
		starting up again, ya know.)

9/19/94	JE	Changed lantern-handling in update_char_objects in handler.c;
		now gives warning one tick before the light expires (idea
		from Chris <ttl6u@fulton.seas.virginia.edu>) and correctly
		decrements world[ch->in_room].light as it should have from
		the very beginning.

9/19/94	JE	Changed the build_house parser in house.c to allow for
		a house which has more than one exit (i.e., only one of
		which is access-controlled) because people seem to want
		multi-room access-controlled areas.

9/19/94	JE	Fixed multi-room-shared-atrium bug in house_control_house,
		house.c (I haven't heard of this bug ever manifesting itself
		but looking at the code I realized the error.)


9/19/94	JE	Changed 'long' to 'time_t' where appropriate.

10/9/94	JE	Added charisma-to-25 code to do_restore (act.wizard.c)

		level entering game

2/22/95 JE	Changed 'color' and 'syslog' to show current levels if typed

2/22/95 JE	fixed castle by adding terminator to end of move string
		reported by Ed Mackey (emackey@BIX.com)

2/22/95 JE	If you try to return to your original body, and someone else
		has connected into it, disconnect them.  act.wizard.c,
		do_return().
		reported by Aaron Mills

2/22/95	JE	interpreter.c - changed the code to sense if a switched
		persona of yourself is connected when you log in.  Should
		make switch more stable.
		reported by Aaron Mills

2/22/95 JE	new timediff in comm.c to work on systems for which
		tv_sec and tv_usec are unsigned
		reported by Steven Serocki <ss@sirocco.cup.hp.com>

		reported by Chris Epler <cepler@ucsee.eecs.berkeley.edu>

2/22/95 JE	act.other.c, do_quit() -- kill off all sockets connected to
		the same player as the one who is trying to quit.  Helps to
		maintain sanity as well as prevent duping.
		duping reported by Chris Epler <cepler@ucsee.eecs.berkeley.edu>

2/22/95	JE	installed new version of Jeff Fink's shop.c code

2/22/95 JE	Patched bug in Jeff Fink's shop code reported by him
		patch send by Jeff Fink

2/22/95 JE	created player_specials structure for new players coming in
		after having been deleted.  Yet another example of a bug that
		could have been avoided completely if we'd been using C++.
		Reported by Jeff Fink

2/22/95 JE	Added code to support 'R' command in zone resets (remove
		obj from room).  Code sent by Jeff Fink.

		generator.

2/23/95	JE	Added 'POSIX_NONBLOCK_BROKEN' option to work around OSs
		such as AIX which don't implement POSIX nonblocking I/O
		correctly, causing the MUD to hang in places such as the
		Password: prompt.

2/23/95 JE	Added a case for sgi (IRIX) in utils.h OS-specific header
		section for cleaner compiles
