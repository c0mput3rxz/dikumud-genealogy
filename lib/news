                      THE DIKUMUD HERALD - May 24th, 1991

NEW STUFF ::

-- SAVE now saves items as well as your character.  In the event of
   a crash, your items are automatically re-imbursed, provided you
   saved.  You will have about 2 hours after a crash to log in 
   before the crash files are removed.

-- The DISPLAY command lets you see your hit pts, move pts, or mana 
   at all times. (Eg., display hp, display move, display all.)

-- WIMPY mode makes you flee when you get hurt bad.

-- Non-dark outside rooms (ie. light forest) now get dark
   when the sun goes down, and light when it comes up.

NEW AREAS ::

--  Drow/desert/lost city sections have been added.

--  New area south of the dump (not made by us).  Its kinda 
    screwed I think, but feel free to look anyway.

--  Check out the graveyard!!!

NEW MONSTER FEATURES ::

Most of these features are not being used by very many mobiles
at this time, but they could be in the future.

--  Infrared vision.
--  Aggressiveness based on the victims alignment.
--  Some monsters have memory. (grin)


P.S. If you find any errors or things that would need a fix, please tell us!

     You can use the commands 'bug', 'typo', and 'idea' for this. Or, for
     longer suggestions, etc:

                      THE DIKUMUD HERALD - June 9th, 1991

NEW STUFF ::

-- get all.obj and put all.obj are now available.

-- lwho == local who; displays just the people in your zone, 
	   and their location.

-- Shopkeepers are now on the Domino's system, and carry no more
   than a fixed amount of gold.

-- Display : all and none can be used now.

-- Practice will now display your skill abilities outside of your guild.

-- Crash files will now remain until the next time you log on.
   This should reduce re-imbursements to zero, but ya never know :-)

MORE DRAMATIC CHANGES :

In an attempt to make the game more fair for mages and clerics,
they will now earn mana points as they gain levels.  Also, 
intelligence and wisdom now play a role in your hit percentage.
Fighters/Thieves should expect to miss a little more now, but
that's why you've got the hit points.  There are objects that
raise wisdom/int....

Experience requirements for clerics/thieves/fighters have been 
raised to make things a little more even.
