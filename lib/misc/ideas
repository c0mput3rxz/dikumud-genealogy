Verdis   (Apr 16) [ 3003] Same as 'look in'.  When trying to reference a mob as if it were an object (in general) perhaps a better error message is in order?

Vortex   (Jun 28) [ 3001] vnums after objects for gods. e.g. A black knight's visor is laying here! (vnum item number) - makes items easier to load, that way you dont have to vnum it first.
Vortex   (Jun 28) [ 3001] when players go linkless, they go to some certain room, and when they reconnect, the mud sends them back to the original room.
