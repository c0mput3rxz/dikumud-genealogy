Guido    (Jun 22) [ 3001] continued from last: Jeremy you use a signed integer here while an unsigned seems better placed. It is not really a bug at all, but i thought is was worth mentioning.
Guido    (Jun 22) [ 3000] singed integers used in boardmessage numbers. This gives the remove 4294967296 (2^32) an error of "you are not using a 4294967296" instead of the message that says  that the article does not exist.
Guido    (Jun 22) [ 3000] I was writing the last bug report when a message saying that i was hungry interrupted, and a prompt appeared. But the bug report continues to function.
