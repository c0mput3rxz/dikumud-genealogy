Scrolls of identify now work better.

Spell abbreviations work (i.e. 'prot f ev' for 'protection from evil').

Speed-walking should be re-enabled.  Please let me know how the new comm
code interacts with tintin and other burst-mode clients.

There is now a 'gold' command.

Aliases are now in!  Type HELP ALIAS for more information.  Note that aliases
are not yet saved when you quit, although they will be in the (very) near
future.
